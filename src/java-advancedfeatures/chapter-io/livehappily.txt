It was many years ago.
I was a young dad sitting on the couch, reading a fairy tale to my little girl.
She sat next to me with her head on my arm as I told the tale.
When it came to the end, I finished with those famous words:“And they lived happily ever after.”
As I looked over to her with her wavy, brown hair and big, innocent eyes, I could see the smile on her face and I never wanted it to end.
It dawned on me then that the ending of the book was what I wanted for her. I wanted her to “live happily ever after.”
Still, deep in my heart, I knew that this couldn’t always be so.
I knew that there would be times when her heart was broken. I knew there would be times when she cried in grief and I couldn’t comfort her. I knew there would be times when all she felt was fear, sadness, sorrow, and despair.
As I stroked her hair and smiled at her, I hoped that those times would be brief and that she would have joy in her life more often than not.
Living happily ever after, though, seemed out of the question.
It took me a lot of years to realize that it is possible to live happily ever after. You just have to do it“one day at a time.”
Happiness isn’t some reward that you get at the end of you journey. Happiness isn’t something dependent on what life hands you.
Happiness is something you create in you life, choice by choice and day by day.
The truth is that happiness comes when you love. It is love that mends broken hearts. It is love that heals grief. It is love that gives us joy.
Choose to “live happily ever after, on day at a time.”
